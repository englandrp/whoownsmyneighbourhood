                <p>Put a Kirklees postcode, or the first half of one (eg HD1), into the search box, and click Go.</p>
                <p>That will take you to a map page showing only two different kinds of land.</p>
                <p>Land owned by the council has a red border and shading...</p>
                <p><img src="/x/img/content/councilland.png" alt="council owned land" /></p>
                <p>... all other land doesn't.</p>
                <p><img src="/x/img/content/otherland.png" alt="other land" /></p>
                <p>Click on a plot of land owned by the council and a pop up will appear with a snapshot of information about that plot of land.</p>

				<h2 class="anchor" id="a_key">What do the different colours on the map mean?</h2>
                <p>Only land owned by the council is shaded red with a darker red border (shown above).</p>
				<p><a href="/help#main" class="quiet">Top of page</a></p>

				<h2 class="anchor" id="a_ownership">How can I find out about land that isn't owned by the Council?</h2>
                <p>The <a href="http://http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/" target="_blank">land registry</a> has some information about privately owned land, but Kirklees Council doesn't have any current information.</p>

				<h2 class="anchor" id="a_landuse">Can we use land owned by the Council?</h2>
                <p>Please get in touch with the council if you want to make significant new use of some of their land in a responsible way, or for any other things you might want to know. Email the Terrier team at dps@kirklees.gov.uk.</p>

				<h2 class="anchor" id="a_contacts">How can I find out who the other community contacts are and the other people registered for updates?</h2>
                <p>Being a community contact is a completely voluntary role and we don't provide the contact details  for these people or those registered for updates to anyone else at all under any circumstances.</p>
                <p>If you want to start working with other people in your area, send a message saying so to the other contacts and suggest meeting on another forum, for example a Facebook group, or through a local organisation. The council might have a community development worker who can help. </p>
                <p>Show some common sense in how you do this and how you use Who Owns My Neighbourhood in general - don't send personal details through Who Owns My Neighbourhood and don't be daft about organising meetings - find an organisation to host it, for example.</p>
